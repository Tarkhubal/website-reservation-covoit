# AMD Eco‑Mobility — interface test (no-js)

Static, offline UI test for an internal mobility platform (carpooling and clean vehicle rental).

Tech: HTML & CSS only — no JavaScript or external dependencies.

Open `no-js/index.html` locally to view the prototype; all assets are local.

Purpose: validate UI/UX with CSS animations and CSS-only interactions (no JS).
